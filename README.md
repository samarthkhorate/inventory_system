Inventory Management System

This repository contains a simple inventory management system built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The system is designed to help track and manage product stock levels, update inventory data, and ensure accurate reporting for efficient business operations.

Features

- Track Product Information: Easily view product details including name, price, and quantity.
- Update Stock Levels: Modify the product quantities to ensure accurate tracking of available items.
- Data Integration: Uses an external dataset (`Inventory.txt`) to store and retrieve product information.

Files in the Repository

- `Inventory_management.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the inventory management system. This notebook includes all the functions required to manage and update the inventory.
  
- `Inventory.txt`: A CSV file that holds the product data including columns for product name, price, quantity, and any additional details.

Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed before running the system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas (for reading and writing CSV files)
- Any other necessary libraries are mentioned in the code

To install the required libraries, you can use the following:

```bash
pip install pandas jupyter
```

How to Run the System

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-system.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook by navigating to the folder and running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the `inventory_system.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

4. Run the cells to load the product data and use the available functions to manage the inventory.

Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication and role-based access to manage the inventory system.
- Include more complex inventory metrics like low-stock alerts and automated purchase orders.
- Add a GUI for better user interaction.
